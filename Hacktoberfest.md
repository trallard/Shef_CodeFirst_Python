# Let's get CodeFirst in Hacktoberfest... and practice what you have learned this week!

1. Go to [https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)  :jack_o_lantern:
 and Sign up using your GitHub account
2. Make sure that your local repository is up to date (Pull your repo! see the GIF below)
![pull](./assets/pull.gif)
3. Also make sure that you are in Master (on GitKraken next to the repository name you should
see 'master')
4. Complete the following tasks

## Task 1
1. Open the `team.md` file contained in the Hacktoberfest folder
![hack](./assets/hack.PNG)
2. Copy the lines in the document and paste them below the dashes (---) replace this with your own personal information and save the document
3. Stage your files, write a commit message and push to your GitHub account
![commit](./assets/com.gif)
4. Create a pull request from your repository to the main `trallard/Shef_CodeFirst_Python` one
![pr](./assets/PR.mp4)


## Task 2
Fun with functions!
1. Create a new script in the Hacktoberfest folder and name it with your own username (e.g for me it would be `trallard.py`)
2. Remember what we learned about use inputs, variables and printing? In your new script create a code for a very basic Starbucks bot 😜 (check exercise 12 from the book for inspiration). Make sure the bot does the following things:
  1. Ask for the user name
  2. Ask for the order
  3. Ask if you want whole milk or almond milk
  4. Print a statement confirming the order and giving a price for this!
3. Make sure it runs, save it, commit your changes in Gitkraken and push to your GitHub account.
4. Create a pull request for this task too!


## Task 3!!! You are almost done!  :fire:
1. Complete Exercise 21 in the Learn the Python the hard way. Save your script as `<username>21.py` (e.g. trallard21.py) in the Hacktoberfest folder.
2. Once completed commit your changes, and push to your repository!
3. Make your final pull request to the repository.

Remember you have up to 11:59pm October 31st to complete this. If you need any help let us know on Facebook, slack or via email!
