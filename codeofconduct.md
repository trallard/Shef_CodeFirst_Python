# Code of Conduct

This code of conduct was adapted from the [Mozilla code of conduct](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/)

These guidelines aim to support a community where all people should feel safe to participate, introduce new ideas and inspire others, regardless of:

* Background
* Family status
* Gender
* Gender identity or expression
* Marital status
* Sex
* Sexual orientation
* Native language
* Age
* Ability
* Race and/or ethnicity
* National origin
* Socioeconomic status
* Religion
* Geographic location
* Any other dimension of diversity

Our main aim is not only to _teach individuals how to code_ but to **build a supportive and empowering community** for and by women interested in pursuing a career in tech.

Hence all the instructors, attendees, helpers, ambassadors, and invited speakers have to adhere to this code of conduct.

Behaviours violating this code of conduct will not be tolerated. If you experience behaviour that makes participation at the workshops not a safe and positive community experience for all please inform your lead instructors: Tania Allard and Darren Vong.

## Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected of all instructors  
and attendees of CodeFirst girls courses:

### Be Respectful

Value each other’s ideas, styles and viewpoints. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. Be open to different possibilities and to being wrong. Be kind in all interactions and communications, especially when debating the merits of different options. Be aware of your impact and how intense interactions may be affecting people. Be direct, constructive and positive. Take responsibility for your impact and your mistakes – if someone says they have been harmed through your words or actions, listen carefully, apologize sincerely, and correct the behavior going forward.

### Be Direct but Professional

We are likely to have some discussions about if and when criticism is respectful and when it’s not. We must be able to speak directly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve. We cannot withhold hard truths. Doing so respectfully is hard, doing so when others don’t seem to be listening is harder, and hearing such comments when one is the recipient can be even harder still. We need to be honest and direct, as well as respectful.

### Be Inclusive

Seek diverse perspectives. Diversity of views and of people on teams powers innovation, even if it is not always comfortable. Encourage all voices. Help new perspectives be heard and listen actively. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, it is especially important to step back and encourage other voices to join in. Be aware of how much time is taken up by dominant members of the group. Provide alternative ways to contribute or participate when possible.

Be inclusive of everyone in an interaction, respecting and facilitating people’s participation whether they are:

* Remote \(on video or phone\)
* Not native language speakers
* Coming from a different culture
* Using pronouns other than “he” or “she”
* Living in a different time zone
* Facing other challenges to participate

Think about how you might facilitate alternative ways to contribute or participate. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, step back. Make way for other voices and listen actively to them.

## Behavior That Will Not Be Tolerated

The following behaviors are considered to be unacceptable under these guidelines.

### Violence and Threats of Violence

Violence and threats of violence are not acceptable - online or offline. This includes incitement of violence toward any individual, including encouraging a person to commit self-harm. This also includes posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information \(“doxxing”\) online.

### Personal Attacks

Conflicts will inevitably arise, but frustration should never turn into a personal attack. It is not okay to insult, demean or belittle others. Attacking someone for their opinions, beliefs and ideas is not acceptable. It is important to speak directly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve, but such discussions must be conducted respectfully and professionally, remaining focused on the issue at hand.

### Derogatory Language

Hurtful or harmful language related to:

* Background
* Family status
* Gender
* Gender identity or expression
* Marital status
* Sex
* Sexual orientation
* Native language
* Age
* Ability
* Race and/or ethnicity
* National origin
* Socioeconomic status
* Religion
* Geographic location
* Other attributes

is not acceptable. This includes deliberately referring to someone by a gender that they do not identify with, and/or questioning the legitimacy of an individual’s gender identity. If you’re unsure if a word is derogatory, don’t use it. This also includes repeated subtle and/or indirect discrimination; when asked to stop, stop the behavior in question.

### Unwelcome Sexual Attention or Physical Contact

Unwelcome sexual attention or unwelcome physical contact is not acceptable. This includes sexualized comments, jokes or imagery in interactions, communications or presentation materials, as well as inappropriate touching, groping, or sexual advances. This includes touching a person without permission, including sensitive areas such as their hair, pregnant stomach, mobility device \(wheelchair, scooter, etc\) or tattoos. This also includes physically blocking or intimidating another person. Physical contact or simulated physical contact \(such as emojis like “kiss”\) without affirmative consent is not acceptable. This includes sharing or distribution of sexualized images or text.

### Disruptive Behavior

Sustained disruption of events, forums, or meetings, including talks and presentations, will not be tolerated. This includes:

* ‘Talking over’ or ‘heckling’ speakers.
* Drinking alcohol to excess or using recreational drugs to excess, or pushing others to do so.
* Making derogatory comments about those who abstain from alcohol or other substances, pushing people to drink, talking about their abstinence or preferences to others, or pressuring them to drink - physically or through jeering.
* Otherwise influencing crowd actions that cause hostility in the session.
