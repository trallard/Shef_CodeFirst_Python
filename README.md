# Code First Girls: Advanced Python course at the University of Sheffield

Course materials for the Advanced Python course in Sheffield ðŸ¤–

<<<<<<< HEAD
I created a custom stylesheet that overrides some of the default styles from the 'reveal.js' themes. This should work with both the 'white' and the 'black' themes. Feel free to use the one you like the most. You only need to modify this directly on the .html file you are working on.

You can check the demo one here: [http://bitsandchips.me/Shef_CodeFirst_Python/](http://bitsandchips.me/Shef_CodeFirst_Python/)


To start creating your own slides just fork the repository, go to the `gh-pages` branch and copy the demo `slide.html` file, rename it with the session number (e.g session1) and get working. Once you have completed your slides make a pull request and assign any other of your fellow instructors as a reviewer. They will then merge your PR.

The slides use reveal.js the GitHub repository for this can be found [here](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/). It has all the documentation in case you want to have a look at it to add fragments, special slides or anything.
