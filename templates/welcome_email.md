Hi all!

First off - congratulations for obtaining a place at the Code First: Girls Python course here at Sheffield University. It’s quite competitive to get in so give yourselves a pat on the back!!

We’re so excited to meet you all on our first session next week on Wednesday 18th of October, 6 - 8pm, Diamond Workroom 1! We’ll go more into depth with introductions in the first session but my name is Pauline. Along with Lakshika, we’ll be your ambassadors for this A/W course.

But before then we’d like to invite you this Thursday to our install-a-thon run by your main instructor, Tania Allard (Sanchez), supported with other instructors, Darren Vong, Chris McIntyre and Nina Swansick. Details are as follows:

Thursday 12th October
5-7:30pm, Diamond Workroom 2

This session is entirely to help you out with installing the correct programs before the course starts and avoid delays installing/sorting out software issues over the course. It would be ideal if you can make it, but if you cannot make the session we can find time to get up to speed!

Additionally, it would be very helpful for all of you to go through the first 8 chapters of the book ‘Learn Python the Hard way’: https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/preface.html
prior to the commencement of the course. It would aid in providing an overview of some very basic Python commands.

Also share with us how excited you are about the course, using our hashtag #shefcodefirst on social media.

We’re all really looking to meeting you! If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask.

Best wishes,
Pauline & Lakshika
CFG Python Ambassadors
